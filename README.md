--------------------------------  
  
## OVERVIEW ##  
Open-source Flux Transport (OFT) is a software suite for generating full-Sun magnetograms through acquiring & processing observational data, generating realistic convective flows, and running them through a flux transport model.  
  
OFT includes the SFT model HipFT as a submodule, with additional submodules for the ConFlow convective flow generation code and MagMAP data acquisition/mapping code to be released soon.
